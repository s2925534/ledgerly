# ResearchBoss

Current version: 0.6.1

ResearchBoss is a local-first, evidence-first research workspace for managing research context, source files, review state, and project memory without requiring cloud services for the MVP.

Phase 1 engine and CLI foundation are complete. The core engine and CLI are importable, tested, and usable for local workspace setup, local source scanning, and source review.

## Project Goals

- Create reproducible local research workspaces.
- Keep source registers, review decisions, context, memory, logs, and generated artefact metadata in project files.
- Support local folder and Zotero storage scanning without modifying original source files.
- Track accepted, ignored, maybe, and pending sources per project.
- Build toward conversion, metadata extraction, data profiling, research question workflows, optional OpenAI assistance, a local FastAPI backend, and future cross-platform UI.

## Current Status

Phase 1 complete:

- Python package structure under `researchboss/`
- Typer CLI command definitions
- Runtime preflight checks through `researchboss doctor` and before `researchboss init`
- Version output through `researchboss version`
- Workspace creation engine
- Default YAML and Markdown workspace files
- Source folder constants
- Source scanning engine for selected file extensions
- Read-only Zotero storage scanning with Zotero storage-key metadata
- Deterministic Zotero storage keyword search over filenames and `.zotero-ft-cache` text
- Read-only local Zotero SQLite metadata lookup without Zotero API use
- Offline Zotero collection listing, selected-collection mode, notes/tags/relations metadata, metadata reports, health reports, snapshots, duplicate checks, and BibTeX export
- Optional read-only Zotero Web API credential test, collection listing, and collection selection
- Planned local FastAPI boundary documented in `docs/api/CONTRACT.md`
- TXT, MD, DOCX, and page-marked PDF conversion into `sources_text/`
- Conversion cache keyed by source hash and failed conversion records under `sources_failed/`
- Deterministic citation metadata extraction without inventing missing fields
- DOI syntax and resolver-link validation, citation consistency reports, metadata duplicate reports, and local keyword indexing
- CSV, SQLite, and JSON data profiling under `outputs/data-profiles/`
- M.Phil and PhD research stage templates
- Research question approve, reject, archive, list, and deterministic readiness-check workflows
- Research question templates for all project types and local warning thresholds
- Manual claim ledger, claim status workflow, claim-source validation, and citation gap reports
- Source notes, manual tags, and source review reports
- Structured decisions, terminology, supervisor/stakeholder feedback, context changelog, and local timeline reports
- Artefact registry records with linked sources, linked research questions, and review flags
- Deterministic artefact creation for source summaries, literature review matrices, claim-evidence tables, research question briefs, and data profile summaries
- Artefact review statuses, artefact dependency validation, and offline evidence bundle export
- Local Markdown report generation, one-shot source watch reports, workspace backups, and config migration
- Workspace health reports and backup restore dry-run inspection
- OpenAI readiness checks through `researchboss ai test`, with live requests requiring explicit `--ai`
- Safe local AI context previews through `researchboss ai context-preview --ai`, excluding original files and whole documents or datasets by default
- AI-assisted review, novelty assessment, research-question assessment, corpus summary, claim-checking, citation-gap, artefact cross-reference, and source-relevance commands, all requiring explicit `--ai`
- Explicit Scopus external-search runs with structured query plans, legacy params-file import, query strategy modes, local snapshots, query validation, quality-scored candidate registers, threshold filters, no-result or low-result logs, saved refine plans, and local candidate reports
- Deterministic document target resolution and `researchboss validate <target>` reports with strengths, weaknesses, unsupported or weakly supported sentences, citation gaps, confidence factors, confidence scores, and APA7 references
- Guideline registration through `researchboss guidelines add`, with local or remote snapshots and extracted text stored inside the workspace, plus validated guideline scopes
- Optional workspace SQLite index and memory layer through `researchboss db init/sync/status/rebuild`, preserving YAML and Markdown as the source of truth
- Reviewed SQLite-to-YAML/Markdown pending-change flow through `researchboss db apply-pending --review` and `researchboss db apply-pending --apply`
- SQLite memory defaults, explicit research index tables, document aliases, bounded FTS indexes, repair checks, and database privacy checks through `researchboss db privacy`
- Zotero-style citation wording during init, including explicit `American Psychological Association 7th edition`
- Strict one-way Zotero-to-ResearchBoss blocker config that prevents writes inside the local Zotero directory
- SHA-256 file hashing
- Duplicate detection by content hash
- Source register records with `pending_review`
- Accept, ignore, and maybe source status helpers
- JSONL logs and YAML run summary helpers
- Local-first and no external search flags in generated config
- Numbered init prompts for research level, citation style, output type, data expectations, source review defaults, and AI preference metadata
- Optional research questions and subquestions captured during init
- Draft research questions stored separately from approved research questions
- Optional supervisor or stakeholder context captured during init
- Workspace discovery and selection when `--workspace` is omitted
- Local default workspace selection stored in ignored local YAML under `workspaces/`
- Concrete next-step command examples after successful init
- Detailed implementation roadmap in `DETAILED_ROADMAP.md`

Known gaps:

- OpenAI readiness, safe context preview, AI-assisted review, novelty assessment, and research-question assessment are implemented with explicit `--ai` opt-in and local report outputs.
- FastAPI, UI, and packaging are planned but not implemented yet.
- Zotero support defaults to local filesystem and read-only SQLite. Optional read-only Zotero Web API collection listing and selection are implemented.
- The source review workflow is implemented for local workspace state. Deterministic artefact creation can consume accepted sources, and AI-assisted review/novelty/RQ assessment can use safe accepted-source context when explicitly enabled with `--ai`.
- Init stores AI preference metadata and keeps AI disabled by default.

## Intended MVP Scope

ResearchBoss should not require Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, SharePoint, AWS, Azure, Firebase, Supabase, or any remote database for the MVP.

The MVP should also avoid external academic search. Source discovery should begin with local folders and Zotero storage folders. Optional Zotero Web API support is limited to read-only collection listing and selection.

## Planned Workspace Files

`researchboss init` is intended to create files such as:

- `research-context.yaml`
- `research-state.yaml`
- `research-stages.yaml`
- `research-questions.yaml`
- `research-question-candidates.yaml`
- `rejected-research-questions.yaml`
- `source-register.yaml`
- `accepted-sources.yaml`
- `ignored-sources.yaml`
- `maybe-sources.yaml`
- `claims-ledger.yaml`
- `novelty-ledger.yaml`
- `terminology.yaml`
- `supervisor-feedback.yaml`
- `decisions.md`
- `memory.md`
- `context-changelog.md`
- `artefact-registry.yaml`
- `app-settings.local.yaml`
- `.gitignore`

It is also intended to create source, artefact, output, log, and context version folders.

By default, new ResearchBoss project workspaces are created under:

```text
workspaces/<project-name>
```

The repository tracks only `workspaces/.keep`; generated workspace contents are ignored.

When commands need a workspace and `--workspace` is omitted, ResearchBoss discovers valid workspaces from the current folder and `./workspaces/*`. If one workspace is found, it is used automatically. If several are found, ResearchBoss shows a numbered list. The first selected workspace can be saved as the local default in:

```text
workspaces/.researchboss-cli.local.yaml
```

That file is ignored with generated workspace contents.

## Development Setup

Requires Python 3.11 or newer.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

Install the project before running the first ResearchBoss command:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
researchboss doctor
researchboss init
```

After `researchboss init`, follow the concrete commands printed by the CLI. A typical first workflow is:

```bash
researchboss scan
researchboss sources review
researchboss sources status
```

`researchboss init` runs a runtime preflight before asking setup questions. If required runtime libraries are missing or the Python version is unsupported, it stops and prints the install command before proceeding.

```

`researchboss artefacts create` is deterministic and non-AI. It only extracts and arranges existing workspace state, excludes ignored sources, writes generated artefacts inside the workspace, marks them as requiring user review, and records `ai_generated: false`.

`researchboss rqs check` is also deterministic and non-AI. It checks question form, scope signals, vague terms, possible multiple-question wording, basic context markers, subquestion alignment, and level-specific readiness hints. It does not validate novelty, contribution strength, field usefulness, or evidence quality; those require human review or later AI-assisted workflows.

For commands that mutate a specific source by ID, passing `--workspace` is still recommended in scripts. In interactive use, omitting `--workspace` triggers the same workspace discovery and default-selection flow.

During `researchboss init`, ResearchBoss looks for a default Zotero storage directory on macOS and Windows. If found, the source prompt defaults to that storage path, for example:

```text
Where are your source files? [/Users/<user>/Zotero/storage]:
```

If Zotero storage is not found, the prompt falls back to:

```text
Where are your source files? [configure_later]:
```

The destination artefact root defaults to the current user's `Documents` directory.

For Zotero storage projects, `researchboss init` stores both the selected `storage/` folder and the parent Zotero directory. `researchboss scan` records the provider as `zotero_storage` from workspace config when `--kind` is omitted. Registered Zotero sources include the storage item key, relative path inside `storage/`, whether Zotero's `.zotero-ft-cache` full-text cache exists, and read-only SQLite metadata when available.

You can search local Zotero storage without AI or the Zotero API:

```bash
researchboss zotero search "evidence synthesis" --workspace <workspace>
researchboss zotero search "local first" --workspace <workspace> --storage /Users/<user>/Zotero/storage
```

These Zotero commands only read supported source files, Zotero `.zotero-ft-cache` text, and `zotero.sqlite` through a read-only immutable SQLite connection. They do not modify Zotero files, write into Zotero storage, call the Zotero local API, or send content to AI services.

ResearchBoss has a hard Zotero safety rule: no development workflow, CLI command, or future AI feature may modify anything inside the local Zotero directory. Derived reports, snapshots, BibTeX files, metadata, and converted text must be written only inside the ResearchBoss workspace.

Optional Zotero Web API support uses `ZOTERO_API_KEY` and `ZOTERO_USER_ID` from `.env` or the process environment. Use a Zotero key with library/notes read access only; do not enable Zotero write access for ResearchBoss.

When Zotero storage is configured, the workspace config includes:

```yaml
zotero:
  strict_one_way_from_zotero_to_researchboss: true
  block_writes_to_zotero_directory: true
```

The init wizard also prompts for optional local context:

- research level / project type using numbered options
- research questions, draft/approved status, and optional subquestions
- supervisor or stakeholder names
- citation style
- primary output type
- whether CSV or SQLite data files are expected
- default status for newly scanned sources, `pending_review` or `maybe`
- AI preference metadata, while keeping AI disabled
- strict evidence mode
- whether to prevent workflows that upload full documents or datasets
- workspace path confirmation when the path is inferred

After init, ResearchBoss prints concrete next-step commands using the actual workspace path and configured source folder when available.

Environment variables are read from the repository root `.env` file during local development. Workspaces do not create their own `.env` files.

## OpenAI Foundation

OpenAI support is optional and disabled by default. `researchboss ai test` checks whether `OPENAI_API_KEY` is available from the process environment, repository `.env`, or workspace `.env` without printing or logging the key. It does not make a live OpenAI request unless `--ai` is passed.

`researchboss ai context-preview --ai` writes a local preview file at `outputs/validation/openai-safe-context.yaml`. It uses accepted source metadata and bounded converted-text excerpts only. It excludes original files, whole PDFs, whole CSV files, whole SQLite databases, and Zotero directory writes by default. It does not call OpenAI.

`researchboss ai review --ai`, `researchboss assess-novelty --ai`, `researchboss rqs assess --ai`, `researchboss ai corpus-summary --ai`, `researchboss ai claim-check --ai`, `researchboss ai citation-gaps --ai`, `researchboss ai artefact-cross-reference --ai`, and `researchboss ai source-relevance --ai` use the same safe context boundary and write local reports. They are AI-assisted outputs, not proof. Human review is required before using their conclusions. External search commands use `--external-search` and write local snapshots/history only inside the workspace.

Source statuses are currently limited to:

- `pending_review`
- `accepted`
- `maybe`
- `ignored`

The source review commands update local workspace YAML files. Conversion, metadata extraction, data profiling, claim checks, and reports are local deterministic workflows and can be filtered by source status where supported.

## Workspace SQLite

`researchboss.sqlite` is optional and local to each workspace. YAML and Markdown files remain the human-readable source of truth. The database is a rebuildable index, cache, memory layer, and controlled sync layer.

Useful commands:

```bash
researchboss db init --workspace workspaces/<workspace-name>
researchboss db sync --workspace workspaces/<workspace-name>
researchboss db status --workspace workspaces/<workspace-name>
researchboss db privacy --workspace workspaces/<workspace-name>
researchboss db apply-pending --review --workspace workspaces/<workspace-name>
researchboss db rebuild --workspace workspaces/<workspace-name>
```

SQLite-to-file write-back is never silent. Proposed database-originated changes must be in the pending-change table and reviewed before `researchboss db apply-pending --apply` writes to YAML or Markdown.

## Validation

Run these checks before committing:

```bash
python -m py_compile researchboss/cli.py researchboss/engine/*.py researchboss/core/*.py
python -m pytest
```

## Roadmap

The detailed living roadmap is maintained in `DETAILED_ROADMAP.md`. Update that file, this README version line, and the changelog whenever development changes project behavior.

1. Phase 1 engine and CLI foundation complete.
2. Conversion and citation metadata extraction complete for deterministic local MVP paths.
3. CSV, SQLite, JSON profiling plus artefact metadata complete for deterministic local MVP paths.
4. Research stages and research question approval workflows complete for deterministic local MVP paths.
5. Add optional OpenAI features with strict privacy boundaries.
6. Add deterministic document validation, guideline handling, citation assistance, and later explicit AI opt-ins for whole-document workflows.
7. Optional workspace SQLite memory, indexing, and sync complete for deterministic local MVP paths.
8. Add a local document vault with versions, manifests, and restoration workflows.
9. Add a local FastAPI backend.
10. Prepare a cross-platform UI.
11. Add packaging plans for desktop distribution.

## Repository Hygiene

Editor settings and local environments are intentionally ignored. `.idea/`, `.venv/`, `.env`, Python caches, pytest caches, and build outputs should stay out of source control.
