# ResearchBoss Local API Contract

This document defines the FastAPI boundary for ResearchBoss.

Contract status: implementation started in project version `0.7.0`; every route documented below is now implemented in `researchboss.api` (run with `researchboss serve`) except the disabled Future AI Routes section. Novelty assessment has no deterministic engine path (`researchboss.engine.ai.ai_novelty_assessment` is AI-only) and stays out of this contract until it can be added under the same AI opt-in and privacy-boundary rules as the Future AI Routes section — it is not simply a missing route shape.

The API must be local-first, workspace-scoped, and a thin transport layer over `researchboss.engine` functions. It must not duplicate business logic already implemented in the engine.

## Non-Negotiable Boundaries

- API routes must not modify original source files.
- API routes must not write inside the local Zotero directory.
- API routes must not require cloud storage or a remote database for MVP operation.
- Zotero Web API routes must be read-only.
- Zotero write routes are forbidden.
- AI routes are future/disabled until privacy-boundary tests exist.
- API keys must not be returned, printed, or logged.
- Whole PDFs, CSV files, SQLite databases, or original documents must not be sent to AI by default.
- Every `/api/v1` route except `/api/v1/auth/login` must fail closed (`503 auth_not_configured`) when no login password is configured, rather than silently allowing unauthenticated access.
- The login password must never be returned, printed, or logged, and session tokens are held in server memory only — never written to YAML, SQLite, or git.
- Upload routes must reject a batch that exceeds its configured file-count limit before writing anything, never silently process a truncated subset. Individual oversized files must be reported as rejected, not silently dropped or partially written without limit.
- Upload routes must stream uploaded bytes to a bounded-size location rather than buffering an entire (potentially oversized) file in memory, and must always clean up temporary upload storage, including on failure.

## Authentication

`researchboss serve` is a single-user local tool, not a multi-tenant service. Set `RESEARCHBOSS_API_PASSWORD` (env var, or `.env` in the server's working directory) before starting the server; every `/api/v1` route except `/api/v1/auth/login` requires a valid session. `GET /health` never requires a session, so deploy/update health checks keep working regardless of login state.

### `POST /api/v1/auth/login` (implemented)

Accepts `{"password": "..."}`. Returns `503 auth_not_configured` if no password is set, `401 invalid_credentials` on a wrong password, or `200` with a session token (also set as an httponly `researchboss_session` cookie) on success. Sessions expire after `RESEARCHBOSS_API_SESSION_HOURS` hours (default 12) and live in server memory only, so a server restart invalidates all sessions.

Engine source:

- `researchboss.api.auth` (server-local, not a `researchboss.engine` module — there is no workspace-scoped concept of a login)

### `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` (implemented)

Invalidates the session named by the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header or the `researchboss_session` cookie, and clears the cookie. No public self-registration route exists.

Callers may authenticate with either the cookie set by `/login` or an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header carrying the same token.

## Common Conventions

Base path:

```text
/api/v1
```

Workspace selection:

- All workspace-scoped routes accept a `workspace` query parameter or a configured workspace ID later.
- Initial MVP may use absolute local workspace paths.
- Future UI layers should pass opaque workspace IDs once a project registry exists.
- When `RESEARCHBOSS_WORKSPACE_ROOT` is set (e.g. a deployed instance pointed at a mounted NAS volume), `workspace` may be a relative path joined to that root, and every resolved workspace must fall inside it — absolute paths outside the root are rejected with `400 workspace_outside_root` rather than accepted. Without it, any path reachable by the server process is accepted, matching local-first single-user CLI behavior.

Response shape:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {},
  "warnings": [],
  "errors": []
}
```

Error shape:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "data": null,
  "warnings": [],
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "workspace_not_found",
      "message": "Workspace does not exist."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Health

### `GET /health` (implemented)

Liveness check outside `/api/v1`, with no workspace or auth dependency, so NAS deploy/update health checks succeed independently of login state.

- `researchboss.engine.artefacts.artefact_dependency_report`

### `POST /api/v1/artefacts/upload` (implemented)

Batch-uploads externally created artefact files (multipart form data, field name `files`) into the document vault. Rejects the whole batch with `400 upload_batch_too_large` if it exceeds `RESEARCHBOSS_UPLOAD_MAX_FILES` (default 25) before writing anything; each file is capped at `RESEARCHBOSS_UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` (default 50) and must have an extension from `researchboss.engine.sources.ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS`. Returns a per-batch report (`processed`/`accepted`/`duplicate`/`rejected`/`failed` counts and per-file rows), also persisted to `outputs/validation/upload-batch-report.yaml`. Duplicate detection is by content hash against artefacts already uploaded in the workspace. Uploaded bytes are streamed to a size-bounded temporary file and the temp directory is always removed after the request, whether it succeeds or fails.

Engine source:

- `researchboss.engine.vault.intake_uploaded_artefact_batch`

### `GET /api/v1/artefacts/cross-reference` (implemented)

Proposes deterministic links between an uploaded artefact (by `upload_id`) and existing artefacts, sources, and claims, based on shared keyword tokens from titles and filenames (claim matches require a stronger overlap, since claim text is long and generic). Read-only: writes a candidate report to `outputs/recommendations/cross-reference-<upload_id>.yaml` but never modifies any artefact, source, or claim record.

Engine source:

- `researchboss.engine.cross_reference.cross_reference_candidates`

### `POST /api/v1/artefacts/cross-reference/apply` (implemented)

Writes reviewed cross-reference candidates as metadata on the *upload* record — a `cross_references` list, mirroring how artefact records already track `linked_sources`/`linked_research_questions` — following the same review-before-apply pattern citation plans use: only candidates whose `review_status` in the persisted candidates report has been hand-edited to `accepted`/`approved` are applied. Deliberately does not insert text into any artefact, source, or claim document's content (the other reading of "write the link" this contract previously left open): a keyword-overlap match is weaker evidence than a validated missing-citation match, so auto-inserting text on that basis would be a worse default than recording it as reviewable metadata. Content insertion analogous to `cite apply` (needing per-format `.md`/`.docx`/`.pdf` handling) was considered and deliberately not chosen. Idempotent — re-applying does not duplicate already-recorded links.

Engine source:

- `researchboss.engine.cross_reference.apply_cross_reference_links`

## Zotero Routes

Engine source:

- `researchboss.engine.vault.compare_document_versions`

### `POST /api/v1/doc/derive-text/{version_id}` (implemented)

Builds (or rebuilds) a derived text snapshot for a document version: sections (from `.md` heading structure only — see engine source docstring for why `.txt`/`.docx`/`.pdf` get no section detection rather than a guessed one), paragraphs with character offsets, and sentences with a `citation_insertion_anchor`, `claim_ids` (claims whose text appears in the sentence), and `reference_ids` (source IDs from this version's linked validation report, when one exists). Anchors are derived fresh from this version's content and are not correlated with any other version's anchors, but are deterministic and stable across repeated calls for the same version. Written to `document_vault/derived_text/<version_id>.yaml`.

Engine source:

- `researchboss.engine.derived_text.build_derived_text_snapshot`

## Validation Routes

### `POST /api/v1/validation/run` (implemented)

- Must never log API keys.
- Must never upload whole PDFs, CSVs, SQLite databases, or original documents unless the user has explicitly opted into that scope.
- Must preserve the Zotero no-write boundary.

## Forbidden Routes

The following route classes must not be added:

- Zotero write routes.
- Routes that write into Zotero storage.
- Routes that delete original source files.
- Routes that require a remote database for MVP operation.
- Routes that sync to Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, SharePoint, AWS, Azure, Firebase, Supabase, or similar services for MVP operation.

## Required Tests Before Implementation

Before a route group is marked implemented, tests must prove that:

- The route calls shared `researchboss.engine` behavior instead of duplicating business logic in the API layer.
- Workspace writes are limited to ResearchBoss workspace files.
- Original source files are not modified.
- Local Zotero directories are never modified.
- Zotero Web API routes use read-only operations only.
- Missing or invalid API keys are handled without printing or logging secrets.
- Future AI routes stay disabled until explicit AI implementation and privacy-boundary tests exist.
