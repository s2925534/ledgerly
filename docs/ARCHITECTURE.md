# ResearchBoss Architecture

ResearchBoss is planned as a layered local-first research workspace.

## Layers

## Core

`researchboss.core` contains small utilities with minimal policy:

- workspace file and folder constants
- YAML read/write helpers
- JSONL run logging
- YAML run summaries

## Engine

`researchboss.engine` contains reusable business logic:

- workspace initialization
- source discovery
- file hashing
- duplicate detection
- source register updates
- source review status transitions
- read-only Zotero storage metadata extraction from local paths
- read-only Zotero SQLite metadata lookup through immutable local connections
- offline Zotero collection listing, selected-collection scans, reports, snapshots, duplicate checks, and BibTeX export
- deterministic Zotero storage keyword search over filenames, `.zotero-ft-cache` text, and local SQLite metadata
- init-time research question capture into approved and draft YAML files
- init-time setup preferences such as citation style, expected data files, source review defaults, AI preference metadata, and privacy preference

The CLI should call engine functions instead of duplicating file mutation logic.

## CLI

`researchboss.cli` is the Typer command layer. It handles prompts, options, progress display, tables, and command-level logging.

The CLI should stay thin so a future FastAPI backend can use the same engine logic.

CLI-only responsibilities include:

- interactive init questions and numbered menu validation
- runtime readiness checks before init and through `researchboss doctor`
- workspace discovery when `--workspace` is omitted
- local default workspace selection stored in `workspaces/.researchboss-cli.local.yaml`
- user-facing next-step command examples

The workspace selector is intentionally local and file-based. It does not introduce a remote registry or database.

## Workspace

A ResearchBoss workspace is a local folder containing YAML, Markdown, source, artefact, output, and log files. The current implementation creates the Phase 1 workspace skeleton and stores source review state in local YAML files.

Workspace identity is currently inferred by the presence of `research-context.yaml` and `source-register.yaml`. Commands that need workspace context can receive `--workspace` explicitly. If omitted, the CLI discovers workspaces from the current directory and `./workspaces/*`; a single discovered workspace is selected automatically, and multiple workspaces are presented as a numbered list.

## Future Backend

The planned FastAPI backend should expose the same engine behavior through local API routes. It should not become a separate business-logic implementation.

## Future UI

The future desktop/web/mobile UI should consume the local API contract. UI state should not be mixed into `researchboss.core` or `researchboss.engine`.

## Privacy Boundary

ResearchBoss should treat original source files as read-only inputs. MVP operation should not require cloud services, remote databases, or external academic search. Optional AI features must use a safe context builder and must not upload whole documents or datasets.

AI behavior is not implemented in Phase 1. Init records only local AI preference metadata and writes `ai.enabled: false` in workspace settings.

Local Zotero support intentionally avoids the Zotero API for now. The engine can scan the `storage/` folder, register supported source files, store the Zotero storage item key, detect `.zotero-ft-cache`, read `zotero.sqlite` through immutable read-only SQLite connections, list and filter collections, enrich source records with metadata, generate local reports, snapshot metadata, detect duplicate candidates, export conservative BibTeX, and search filename/cache/metadata text deterministically. ResearchBoss must not write into Zotero storage or modify Zotero-owned files.
