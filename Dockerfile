# Single-user tool: session state (corroborly/api/auth.py) is an in-memory
# dict, not shared across processes. Do not add `--workers N` (N>1) to the
# CMD below or scale this service to more than one replica -- login sessions
# would randomly fail depending on which worker/replica handled a given
# request, since only the process that issued a session token knows it is
# valid. Exactly one process, one container.

# tesseract/poppler back the optional --ocr conversion fallback (see
# docs/PACKAGING.md). Included here because a shared deployment is a
# reasonable place to make that opt-in feature actually usable -- unlike a
# packaged desktop binary, which cannot bundle these external CLI tools at
# all and must rely on whatever the end user has installed locally.

# Audio/video transcription (Phase 30, CORROBORLY_SOURCESCRIBE_PATH) is not
# bundled here: unlike tesseract/poppler, SourceScribe is a whole separate
# sibling project with its own Python deps and a local Whisper model, not a
# couple of apt packages. A server deployment that wants transcription needs
# its own SourceScribe checkout mounted into the container (or run alongside
# it) and CORROBORLY_SOURCESCRIBE_PATH pointed at that mount -- not something
# this image does automatically.
