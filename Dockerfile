# Single-user tool: session state (ledgerly/api/auth.py) is an in-memory
# dict, not shared across processes. Do not add `--workers N` (N>1) to the
# CMD below or scale this service to more than one replica -- login sessions
# would randomly fail depending on which worker/replica handled a given
# request, since only the process that issued a session token knows it is
# valid. Exactly one process, one container.

# packaged desktop binary, which cannot bundle these external CLI tools at
# all and must rely on whatever the end user has installed locally.
