# ResearchBoss Detailed Roadmap

Project version: 0.3.0

Last updated: 2026-07-03

This roadmap tracks implementation progress for ResearchBoss. Update this file whenever development changes feature status, project scope, version, or recommended next steps.

## 1. Executive Summary

ResearchBoss is currently past the local deterministic Phase 2-4 foundation and still before AI, FastAPI, UI, and packaging.

Implemented:

- Python package structure.
- Typer CLI foundation.
- Local workspace initialization.
- Local YAML and Markdown workspace state files.
- Source folder scanning.
- Read-only local Zotero storage scanning.
- Read-only local Zotero SQLite metadata lookup.
- Offline Zotero collection listing and selected-collection scan modes.
- Deterministic local Zotero search over filenames, `.zotero-ft-cache`, and local SQLite metadata.
- Offline Zotero metadata reports, attachment health checks, full-text cache reports, metadata snapshots, duplicate checks, and BibTeX export.
- Source hashing and duplicate detection.
- TXT, MD, DOCX, and page-marked PDF conversion.
- Conversion cache and failed conversion records.
- Deterministic citation metadata extraction.
- CSV, SQLite, and JSON data profiling.
- Artefact registry with linked sources, linked research questions, review flags, and AI flags.
- M.Phil and PhD stage templates.
- Research question list, approve, reject, and archive workflows.
- Manual claim ledger and citation gap detection.
- Local Markdown workspace reports.
- One-shot watch reports for unregistered source files.
- Local workspace backups.
- Config migration and workspace schema versioning.
- Source review statuses: `pending_review`, `accepted`, `maybe`, `ignored`.
- Workspace discovery, selection, and local default workspace memory.
- JSONL logs and YAML run summaries.
- README, AGENTS.md, architecture notes, TODO, changelog, and tests.

Partially implemented:

- Zotero support: local storage-folder and read-only SQLite support exist; Zotero API integration is not implemented.
- AI setup: local preference metadata exists; AI behavior is not implemented.

Not implemented:

- Optional OpenAI workflows.
- FastAPI backend.
- Cross-platform UI.
- Packaging.

Current repository state: coherent and test-covered for local deterministic engine and CLI workflows through conversion, metadata, data profiling, Zotero offline support, research questions, claims, reports, backup, and migration.

## 6. Config and Workspace Audit

Workspace creation currently generates the Phase 1 file and folder skeleton, including research context/state files, source registers, review lists, ledgers, terminology, feedback, memory files, artefact registry, app settings, `.gitignore`, source folders, artefact folders, output folders, logs, run summaries, and context versions.

Zotero config now stores both the selected `storage/` path and the parent Zotero directory when `sources.mode` is `zotero_storage`.

## 7. Source Workflow Audit

Implemented:

- Discover local source files.
- Hash files.
- Detect duplicates by hash.
- Create source IDs.
- Mark new sources as `pending_review` or `maybe`.
- Accept, ignore, and maybe source workflow.
- Exclude ignored/accepted/maybe state per workspace.

Missing or future:

- Metadata-only source status.
- Failed conversion status.
- Conversion outputs and metadata.
- Data profile statuses.
- Manual review required status beyond current config flag.
- Downstream enforcement that only accepted sources are used for research tasks.

## 8. Zotero Audit

Implemented:

- Detect default Zotero `storage/` path on macOS and Windows.
- Scan local Zotero storage folders.
- Store Zotero parent root automatically.
- Record Zotero storage key and relative storage path.
- Detect `.zotero-ft-cache`.
- Read local `zotero.sqlite` through immutable read-only SQLite connections.
- Link storage files to parent Zotero items.
- List local collections.
- Select one or more local collections for future scans.
- Include or exclude subcollections.
- Switch between entire-library and selected-collections mode.
- Search filenames, `.zotero-ft-cache`, title, creators, abstract, DOI, and collection paths deterministically.
- Generate metadata quality, attachment health, and full-text availability reports.
- Create local metadata snapshots.
- Enrich source-register entries with local Zotero metadata.
- Detect possible metadata duplicates by DOI or title/year.
- Export conservative BibTeX from local metadata.
- Avoid modifying Zotero files.
- Avoid writing into Zotero storage.

Missing:

- Zotero local API.
- Richer local metadata coverage for tags, notes, relations, and item links.
- More complete BibTeX item-type mapping.

## 9. Data Source Audit

Status: implemented for deterministic local MVP paths.

Implemented:

- CSV profiling.
- SQLite profiling.
- JSON source registration.
- Data source statuses.
- Data profile reports.
- No AI dataset upload behavior exists.

## 10. Artefact Audit

Status: implemented for deterministic local MVP paths.

Implemented:

- Artefact folders.
- `artefact-registry.yaml` shell.
- Artefact metadata records.
- Linked sources and research questions.
- AI-generated flag.
- `requires_user_review` flag.

## 11. AI and OpenAI Audit

Status: not implemented.

Implemented:

- AI preference metadata.
- `ai.enabled: false` in local app settings.
- `.env` ignored.
- `.env.example` exists.

Missing:

- OpenAI provider setup command.
- API key validation.
- Safe context builder.
- Novelty assessment.
- Corpus summary behavior.
- Privacy-boundary tests.

## 12. Tests Audit

Framework: pytest.

Current tested areas:

- CLI smoke tests.
- Workspace initialization.
- Source scanning and review.
- Workspace selection.
- Runtime checks.
- Local Zotero storage helpers, SQLite metadata, collection filtering, reports, snapshots, duplicate checks, BibTeX export, and CLI search.
- Conversion, metadata extraction, data profiling, artefact registry, research questions, claims, reports, watch, backup, and migration.

Current expected validation:

```bash
python -m py_compile researchboss/cli.py researchboss/engine/*.py researchboss/core/*.py
python -m pytest
```

Recommended next tests:

- Integrated review workflow tests once review commands are added.
- Future AI privacy-boundary tests before any AI implementation.

## 13. Security and Privacy Audit

Current privacy posture:

- MVP does not require cloud services.
- No external academic search.
- No AI document upload behavior exists.
- Source files are read-only inputs.
- Zotero storage is read-only.
- `.env` is ignored.

Known follow-up:

- Add tests for future AI privacy boundaries before implementing AI-assisted flows.

## 14. Documentation Audit

Implemented:

- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `TODO.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `DETAILED_ROADMAP.md`
- Setup and test instructions.
- Initial OpenAI and Zotero notes.
- Local-first privacy boundaries.

Missing:

- Full API contract.
- Desktop/web/mobile strategy.
- Packaging documentation.

## 15. Immediate Next Steps

1. Validate scan provider values.
   - Why: prevent accidental unknown provider strings in source records.
   - Likely files: `sources.py`, `cli.py`, tests.
   - Tests: invalid `--kind`.
   - Complexity: low.
   - Phase: 1 refinement.

2. Add richer local Zotero metadata coverage.
    - Why: tags, notes, item links, and relations can improve offline review without AI/API.
    - Likely files: `zotero.py`, tests, docs.
    - Tests: SQLite fixture for notes/tags/relations.
    - Complexity: medium.
    - Phase: 1 refinement / Phase 2 support.

3. Add integrated source review/report workflow.
   - Why: ties source review, conversion, metadata, claims, and reports into one deterministic command.
   - Likely files: `cli.py`, new engine module, tests.
   - Tests: end-to-end local workspace workflow.
   - Complexity: medium.
   - Phase: 4 refinement.

4. Add richer PDF extraction using an optional local dependency.
   - Why: current PDF support is intentionally conservative for simple uncompressed streams.
   - Likely files: conversion engine, docs, tests.
   - Tests: realistic PDF fixture.
   - Complexity: medium.
   - Phase: 2 refinement.

5. Start FastAPI local backend contracts.
   - Why: deterministic engine contracts now exist for CLI reuse.
   - Likely files: `researchboss/api`, tests, docs.
   - Tests: API route tests.
   - Complexity: high.
   - Phase: 6.

## 16. Recommended Resume Point

Resume with either one final Phase 1 refinement, scan provider validation, or begin Phase 6 FastAPI local backend contracts. AI remains intentionally out of scope until explicit privacy-boundary tests and safe context contracts are designed.

## 17. Maintenance Rule

Whenever development changes ResearchBoss behavior:

- Update this roadmap.
- Update `README.md` project version.
- Update package version in `pyproject.toml` and `researchboss/__init__.py` when releasing or committing user-visible feature work.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Keep tests passing before commit or push.
