# ResearchBoss Detailed Roadmap

Project version: 0.5.4

Last updated: 2026-07-04

This roadmap tracks implementation progress for ResearchBoss. Update this file whenever development changes feature status, project scope, version, or recommended next steps.

## 1. Executive Summary

ResearchBoss is currently past the local deterministic Phase 2-6 foundation for core workspace, source, artefact, external-search, document-validation, and guideline-registration workflows. SQLite memory, document vault/versioning, FastAPI, UI, and packaging remain future phases.

Implemented:

- Python package structure.
- Typer CLI foundation.
- Local workspace initialization.
- Local YAML and Markdown workspace state files.
- Source folder scanning.
- Read-only local Zotero storage scanning.
- Read-only local Zotero SQLite metadata lookup.
- Offline Zotero collection listing and selected-collection scan modes.
- Optional read-only Zotero Web API credential test, collection listing, and selected-collection configuration.
- Offline Zotero notes, tags, relations, linked-item metadata, and richer BibTeX mapping.
- Deterministic local Zotero search over filenames, `.zotero-ft-cache`, and local SQLite metadata.
- Offline Zotero metadata reports, attachment health checks, full-text cache reports, metadata snapshots, duplicate checks, and BibTeX export.
- Source hashing and duplicate detection.
- TXT, MD, DOCX, and page-marked PDF conversion.
- Conversion cache and failed conversion records.
- Deterministic citation metadata extraction.
- DOI validation, citation consistency reports, metadata duplicate reports, and converted-text keyword indexing.
- CSV, SQLite, and JSON data profiling.
- Artefact registry with linked sources, linked research questions, review flags, and AI flags.
- Deterministic artefact creation for source summaries, literature review matrices, claim-evidence tables, research question briefs, and data profile summaries.
- Artefact review status, artefact dependency validation, and evidence bundle export.
- M.Phil and PhD stage templates.
- Research question templates, list, approve, reject, archive, and deterministic readiness-check workflows.
- Source notes, manual source tags, and source review reports.
- Manual claim ledger, claim statuses, claim-source validation, and citation gap detection.
- Structured decision log, terminology glossary, supervisor/stakeholder feedback, context changelog, and local timeline reports.
- Local Markdown workspace reports.
- One-shot watch reports for unregistered source files.
- Local workspace backups.
- Workspace health reports and backup restore dry-run inspection.
- Config migration and workspace schema versioning.
- Zotero-style citation style wording, including explicit `American Psychological Association 7th edition`.
- Strict one-way Zotero-to-ResearchBoss blocker config that prevents writes inside the local Zotero directory.
- Source review statuses: `pending_review`, `accepted`, `maybe`, `ignored`.
- Workspace discovery, selection, and local default workspace memory.
- JSONL logs and YAML run summaries.
- OpenAI readiness checks through `researchboss ai test`, with live requests requiring explicit `--ai`.
- Safe AI context preview generation that excludes original files, whole documents, whole CSVs, and whole SQLite databases by default.
- AI-assisted review, novelty assessment, and research-question assessment behind explicit `--ai`.
- Document target resolution for file paths, artefact IDs, artefact titles, primary aliases, and deterministic artefact types.
- Deterministic `researchboss validate <target>` reports with source comparison, strengths, weaknesses, unsupported or weakly supported sentences, missing citations, evidence confidence factors, conservative confidence scores, and APA7 references.
- Guideline registration with workspace-local snapshots, extracted text, and validated scopes.
- README, AGENTS.md, architecture notes, TODO, changelog, detailed roadmap, and tests.
- Planned local FastAPI API contract in `docs/api/CONTRACT.md`.

Partially implemented:

- Zotero support: local storage-folder, read-only SQLite support, and read-only Zotero Web API collection listing/selection exist.
- AI setup: OpenAI readiness, safe context preview, AI-assisted review, novelty assessment, and research-question assessment exist.

Not implemented:

- Future explicit full-file/directory AI opt-ins, AI-assisted abstract screening, citation insertion, SQLite memory, document vault/versioning, FastAPI, UI, and packaging.
- Workspace SQLite memory and sync.
- Document vault and versioning.
- FastAPI backend.
- Cross-platform UI.
- Packaging.

Current repository state: coherent and test-covered for local deterministic engine and CLI workflows through conversion, metadata, data profiling, Zotero offline support, external search, document validation, guideline registration, research questions, claims, reports, backup, and migration.

Deterministic boundary:

- Current non-AI workflows may extract, count, list, copy metadata, link explicit IDs, profile files, and create fixed templates from workspace state.
- Current non-AI workflows must not interpret meaning, judge usefulness, assess novelty, infer evidence strength, synthesize arguments, rank relevance beyond explicit rule-based matching, or create conclusions from source content.
- Anything not safely deterministic belongs to the later AI implementation phase, behind explicit user opt-in, privacy-boundary tests, and workspace-only output rules.

## 6. Config and Workspace Audit

Workspace creation currently generates the Phase 1 file and folder skeleton, including research context/state files, source registers, review lists, ledgers, terminology, feedback, memory files, artefact registry, app settings, `.gitignore`, source folders, artefact folders, output folders, logs, run summaries, and context versions.

Zotero config now stores both the selected `storage/` path and the parent Zotero directory when `sources.mode` is `zotero_storage`.

## 7. Source Workflow Audit

Implemented:

- Hash files.
- Detect duplicates by hash.
- Create source IDs.
- Mark new sources as `pending_review` or `maybe`.
- Accept, ignore, and maybe source workflow.
- Exclude ignored/accepted/maybe state per workspace.

Missing or future:

- Metadata-only source status.
- Failed conversion status.
- Conversion outputs and metadata.
- Data profile statuses.
- Manual review required status beyond current config flag.
- Downstream enforcement that only accepted sources are used for research tasks.

## 8. Zotero Audit

Implemented:

- Detect default Zotero `storage/` path on macOS and Windows.
- Scan local Zotero storage folders.

- Read local `zotero.sqlite` through immutable read-only SQLite connections.
- Link storage files to parent Zotero items.
- List local collections.
- Select one or more local collections for future scans.
- Include or exclude subcollections.
- Switch between entire-library and selected-collections mode.
- Search filenames, `.zotero-ft-cache`, title, creators, abstract, DOI, and collection paths deterministically.
- Generate metadata quality, attachment health, and full-text availability reports.
- Create local metadata snapshots.
- Enrich source-register entries with local Zotero metadata.
- Detect possible metadata duplicates by DOI or title/year.
- Export conservative BibTeX from local metadata.
- Avoid modifying Zotero files.
- Avoid writing into Zotero storage.
- Enforce the hard project rule that no CLI workflow, development workflow, or future AI feature may modify anything inside the local Zotero directory.
- Workspace config stores `strict_one_way_from_zotero_to_researchboss: true` and `block_writes_to_zotero_directory: true`.

Missing:

- Zotero local API.

## 9. Data Source Audit

Status: implemented for deterministic local MVP paths.

Implemented:

- CSV profiling.
- SQLite profiling.
- JSON source registration.
- Data source statuses.
- Data profile reports.
- No AI dataset upload behavior exists.

## 10. Artefact Audit

Status: implemented for deterministic local MVP paths.

Implemented:

- Artefact folders.
- `artefact-registry.yaml` shell.
- Artefact metadata records.
- Linked sources and research questions.
- AI-generated flag.
- `requires_user_review` flag.

## 11. AI and OpenAI Audit

Status: implemented for current safe-context MVP workflows.

Implemented:

- AI preference metadata.
- `ai.enabled: false` in local app settings.
- `.env` ignored.
- `.env.example` exists.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` loaded from environment or local `.env`.
- API key is not printed or logged.
- `researchboss ai test` writes a local readiness report.
- `researchboss ai context-preview --ai` writes a local safe context preview without making an OpenAI request.
- `researchboss ai review --ai` writes a local AI-assisted review report.
- `researchboss assess-novelty --ai` writes a local novelty report and appends `novelty-ledger.yaml`.
- `researchboss rqs assess --ai` writes a local AI-assisted research-question assessment report.
- Tests cover missing key behavior, key non-disclosure, explicit `--ai`, no default whole-document/dataset inclusion, mocked AI workflow outputs, and explicit external-search opt-in.

Missing:

- AI-assisted abstract screening for local abstract imports.
- Explicit full-file and directory opt-in modes.

Planned AI options:

- Workflows marked as not safely deterministic will be implemented only in the AI phase, not in the current deterministic engine.
- Research question strength, novelty, contribution certainty, field usefulness, and evidence-quality reasoning will be AI-assisted or human-review workflows, not deterministic validators.
- Explicit user-controlled options to allow AI to read an entire file when the user approves that level of context.
- Explicit user-controlled options to allow AI to read a directory of files when the user approves that level of context.
- Optional full-paper reasoning mode for consuming entire papers.
- Optional cross-reference mode where AI can compare full papers against in-progress artefacts.
- These modes must be disabled by default, must never modify Zotero, and must keep outputs inside the ResearchBoss workspace.

Future AI work that makes sense to implement next:

- AI-assisted abstract screening for locally imported abstracts, writing recommendations only.
- Explicit per-run full-file AI opt-in flags with warning output and tests.
- Explicit per-run directory AI opt-in flags with warning output and tests.
- Optional AI-assisted query generation, query refinement, paper relevance review, research-question validation, idea validation, and novelty validation using safe context first and full text only by explicit opt-in.

## 11.1 External Search Quality Roadmap

Goal: use external scholarly search as a controlled evidence-discovery workflow, not an unbounded automation loop.

Implemented baseline:

- `researchboss search plan` creates deterministic query plans from project context and research questions.
- `researchboss search scopus --external-search` runs explicit Scopus searches and stores response snapshots.
- `researchboss search scopus-test --external-search` checks credentials without printing keys.
- Search query history and no-result snapshots are written inside the ResearchBoss workspace.
- Scopus search runs now write quality-scored candidate registers, threshold-filtered candidate lists, query validation reports, low-result logs, and metadata-only full-text availability signals.
- Query planning now supports legacy params-file import, broad/balanced/strict strategy modes, structured query records, query group labels, and research-question links.

Planned deterministic work:

- Expand configurable thresholds to include document type, source type, maximum queries per run, maximum refinement rounds, and elapsed-time budget.
- Expand query validation reports to compare candidates against approved research questions, accepted source metadata, local keyword indexes, and citation gap reports.
- Expand deterministic query refinement candidates from approved RQs, inclusion/exclusion terms, local keyword indexes, accepted source metadata, and citation gap reports.
- Expand query group labels so queries can also be linked to claim gaps, source gaps, and manual search objectives.
- Add deterministic auto-refine planning that writes broader follow-up queries when search yield is weak, but requires explicit user approval before making another API run.
- Add query exhaustion protection: maximum API calls, maximum generated queries, maximum refinement rounds, maximum pages, maximum candidate records, and maximum elapsed time.
- Add filtered-candidate logs with explicit threshold-failure reasons such as year, citation count, document type, source type, missing DOI, missing abstract, duplicate DOI/EID, or incomplete metadata.
- Add batch search run summaries that aggregate processed, candidate, filtered, skipped, duplicate, no-result, and low-result counts across many queries.
- Add high-signal candidate reports sorted by quality score, RQ coverage, citation count, recency, open-access flag, metadata completeness, and duplicate status.
- Add candidate deduplication across Scopus runs, local Zotero metadata, source register records, DOI, EID, title, and year.
- Add external-search run comparison reports to identify which query strategies produced the strongest candidate yield.
- Add local Zotero matching to full-text availability detection. Do not download, scrape, or bypass access controls.
- Add user-approved candidate import so selected external results become metadata-only pending-review sources.
- Add evidence validation reports that compare candidate papers against RQs, claims, novelty ledger entries, artefacts, and known source gaps.
- Expand reproducibility files for every external search run with skipped candidate reason details, threshold set IDs, and run-level search budgets.

Planned AI-assisted work:

- Add optional AI-assisted query generation and refinement only when both `--ai` and `--external-search` are supplied.
- Add optional AI-assisted relevance, idea validation, RQ validation, and novelty validation using candidate metadata and abstracts first.
- Add explicit full-text AI modes later, with warnings and per-run opt-in, for cases where the user approves whole-paper reasoning.

## 11.2 Legacy Project Lessons

The old `../pdf-merge` project is useful as workflow evidence, but ResearchBoss should not inherit its ad hoc file movement, cloud sync assumptions, automatic full-text retrieval attempts, or deletion of intermediate text. The useful ideas should be rebuilt as local-first, manifest-driven engine workflows.

Useful patterns to bring forward:

- Params-file import for curated query groups such as RQ1/RQ2/RQ3.
- Query history with skip/re-run controls.
- Broad, balanced, and strict query strategy modes.
- Search quality thresholds and batch-level search summaries.
- No-result, low-result, filtered, skipped, and not-relevant logs.
- Abstract text-file import from old Scopus exports.
- Combined abstract/text corpus export with source headers and separators.
- PDF merge artefacts for accepted sources, always generated inside ResearchBoss artefact folders.
- OCR readiness checks and optional local OCR fallback for scanned PDFs.
- Manifest-first processing so every merge/export/search run records included, skipped, failed, and generated files.

Rules for adapting these ideas:

- Never move, rename, delete, or overwrite original source files.
- Never write into Zotero storage or another external library directory.
- Do not add Google Drive, cloud sync, or remote storage assumptions.
- Do not automatically retrieve full text from publisher APIs. Detect availability, then require explicit user action.
- Do not treat AI relevance labels as source status changes. AI can recommend; the user or deterministic commands must confirm.
- Preserve all intermediate text and metadata files unless the user explicitly runs a cleanup command.

## 12. Tests Audit

Framework: pytest.

Current tested areas:

- CLI smoke tests, including document validation and guideline registration commands.
- Workspace initialization.
- Source scanning and review.
- Workspace selection.
- Runtime checks.
- Local Zotero storage helpers, SQLite metadata, collection filtering, reports, snapshots, duplicate checks, BibTeX export, and CLI search.
- Conversion, metadata extraction, data profiling, artefact registry, research questions, claims, document validation, guidelines, reports, watch, backup, and migration.

Current expected validation:

```bash
python -m py_compile researchboss/cli.py researchboss/engine/*.py researchboss/core/*.py
python -m pytest
```

Recommended next tests:

- Integrated review workflow tests once review commands are added.
- Future AI privacy-boundary tests before any AI implementation.

## 13. Security and Privacy Audit

Current privacy posture:

- MVP does not require cloud services.
- No external academic search.
- No AI document upload behavior exists.
- Source files are read-only inputs.
- Zotero storage is read-only.
- The local Zotero directory is a hard no-write boundary for current and future non-AI or AI workflows.
- Future AI whole-file, whole-directory, full-paper, and artefact cross-reference modes must be explicit opt-in settings and must preserve the Zotero no-write boundary.
- `.env` is ignored.

Known follow-up:

- Add tests for future AI privacy boundaries before implementing AI-assisted flows.

## 14. Documentation Audit

Implemented:

- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `TODO.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `DETAILED_ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/api/CONTRACT.md`
- Setup and test instructions.
- Initial OpenAI and Zotero notes.
- Local-first privacy boundaries.

Missing:

- Desktop/web/mobile strategy.
- Packaging documentation.

## 15. Immediate Next Steps

Phase 1 through the currently implemented deterministic Phase 6 work is complete for the committed items. Remaining work includes Phase 2 PDF/text enhancements, Phase 6 guideline/citation follow-ups, Phase 7 SQLite memory, Phase 8 document vault/versioning, API/backend work, AI privacy-boundary work, UI preparation, and packaging.

1. Add richer PDF extraction using an optional local dependency.
   - Why: current PDF support is intentionally conservative for simple uncompressed streams.
   - Likely files: conversion engine, docs, tests.
   - Tests: realistic PDF fixture.
   - Complexity: medium.
   - Phase: 2 enhancement, not blocking Phase 2 completion.

2. Add guideline defaults, priorities, and command integration.
   - Why: guideline registration and scopes now exist, but commands do not yet apply default guideline sets.
   - Likely files: guideline engine, workspace config, CLI, tests.
   - Tests: default guideline selection, precedence, and `--no-default-guidelines`.
   - Complexity: medium.
   - Phase: 6.

3. Start SQLite memory and sync design after guideline defaults are stable.
   - Why: SQLite should index and remember workspace state without replacing YAML/Markdown as the human-readable source of truth.
   - Likely files: new database engine module, CLI commands, tests.
   - Tests: init/status/sync/rebuild, hash tracking, pending-change behavior.
   - Complexity: high.
   - Phase: 7.

## 15a. Useful Ideas Learned From `../pdf-merge`

The old project is useful as a reference for ResearchBoss, but its cloud-sync and external-search assumptions should not be copied into the MVP. Useful patterns to port or redesign:

- A richer local document-processing layer with optional PyMuPDF/PyPDF2 extraction and local OCR fallback.
- Sidecar metadata readers for CSL JSON, BibTeX, and RIS.
- Abstract and keyword extraction from sidecar files and early PDF pages.
- Accepted-source text corpus export with strong source headers and separators.
- PDF merge artefacts for accepted sources, including batch and library-wide outputs.
- Merge manifests, index files, and CSV reports for reproducible generated artefacts.
- Deterministic title/author/year filename normalization for generated outputs only.
- Local abstract import/screening workflows for already collected abstracts.
- Query-plan and query-history utilities for a later post-MVP external search phase.

Not suitable for MVP right now:

- Google Drive sync.
- External Scopus search.
- Any workflow that moves, renames, or modifies original source files.
- Any workflow that writes inside Zotero storage.

## 16. Recommended Resume Point

Resume with either Phase 6 guideline defaults/priorities, a Phase 2 PDF extraction enhancement, or Phase 7 SQLite memory design. FastAPI remains Phase 9 and should wait until the validation, citation, SQLite, and document-vault engine contracts are stable. AI work remains intentionally separated until privacy-boundary tests are designed.

## 17. Maintenance Rule

Whenever development changes ResearchBoss behavior:

- Update this roadmap.
- Update `README.md` project version.
- Update package version in `pyproject.toml` and `researchboss/__init__.py` when releasing or committing user-visible feature work.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Keep tests passing before commit or push.
