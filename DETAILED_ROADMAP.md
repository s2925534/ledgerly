# ResearchBoss Detailed Roadmap

Project version: 0.5.2

Last updated: 2026-07-03

This roadmap tracks implementation progress for ResearchBoss. Update this file whenever development changes feature status, project scope, version, or recommended next steps.

## 1. Executive Summary

ResearchBoss is currently past the local deterministic Phase 2-4 foundation and still before AI, FastAPI, UI, and packaging.

Implemented:

- Python package structure.
- Typer CLI foundation.
- Local workspace initialization.
- Local YAML and Markdown workspace state files.
- Source folder scanning.
- Read-only local Zotero storage scanning.
- Read-only local Zotero SQLite metadata lookup.
- Offline Zotero collection listing and selected-collection scan modes.
- Optional read-only Zotero Web API credential test, collection listing, and selected-collection configuration.
- Offline Zotero notes, tags, relations, linked-item metadata, and richer BibTeX mapping.
- Deterministic local Zotero search over filenames, `.zotero-ft-cache`, and local SQLite metadata.
- Offline Zotero metadata reports, attachment health checks, full-text cache reports, metadata snapshots, duplicate checks, and BibTeX export.
- Source hashing and duplicate detection.
- TXT, MD, DOCX, and page-marked PDF conversion.
- Conversion cache and failed conversion records.
- Deterministic citation metadata extraction.
- DOI validation, citation consistency reports, metadata duplicate reports, and converted-text keyword indexing.
- CSV, SQLite, and JSON data profiling.
- Artefact registry with linked sources, linked research questions, review flags, and AI flags.
- Deterministic artefact creation for source summaries, literature review matrices, claim-evidence tables, research question briefs, and data profile summaries.
- Artefact review status, artefact dependency validation, and evidence bundle export.
- M.Phil and PhD stage templates.
- Research question templates, list, approve, reject, archive, and deterministic readiness-check workflows.
- Source notes, manual source tags, and source review reports.
- Manual claim ledger, claim statuses, claim-source validation, and citation gap detection.
- Structured decision log, terminology glossary, supervisor/stakeholder feedback, context changelog, and local timeline reports.
- Local Markdown workspace reports.
- One-shot watch reports for unregistered source files.
- Local workspace backups.
- Workspace health reports and backup restore dry-run inspection.
- Config migration and workspace schema versioning.
- Zotero-style citation style wording, including explicit `American Psychological Association 7th edition`.
- Strict one-way Zotero-to-ResearchBoss blocker config that prevents writes inside the local Zotero directory.
- Source review statuses: `pending_review`, `accepted`, `maybe`, `ignored`.
- Workspace discovery, selection, and local default workspace memory.
- JSONL logs and YAML run summaries.
- OpenAI readiness checks through `researchboss ai test`, with live requests requiring explicit `--ai`.
- Safe AI context preview generation that excludes original files, whole documents, whole CSVs, and whole SQLite databases by default.
- AI-assisted review, novelty assessment, and research-question assessment behind explicit `--ai`.
- README, AGENTS.md, architecture notes, TODO, changelog, and tests.
- Planned local FastAPI API contract in `docs/api/CONTRACT.md`.

Partially implemented:

- Zotero support: local storage-folder, read-only SQLite support, and read-only Zotero Web API collection listing/selection exist.
- AI setup: OpenAI readiness, safe context preview, AI-assisted review, novelty assessment, and research-question assessment exist.

Not implemented:

- Future explicit full-file/directory AI opt-ins and AI-assisted abstract screening.
- FastAPI backend.
- Cross-platform UI.
- Packaging.

Current repository state: coherent and test-covered for local deterministic engine and CLI workflows through conversion, metadata, data profiling, Zotero offline support, research questions, claims, reports, backup, and migration.

Deterministic boundary:

- Current non-AI workflows may extract, count, list, copy metadata, link explicit IDs, profile files, and create fixed templates from workspace state.
- Current non-AI workflows must not interpret meaning, judge usefulness, assess novelty, infer evidence strength, synthesize arguments, rank relevance beyond explicit rule-based matching, or create conclusions from source content.
- Anything not safely deterministic belongs to the later AI implementation phase, behind explicit user opt-in, privacy-boundary tests, and workspace-only output rules.

## 6. Config and Workspace Audit

Workspace creation currently generates the Phase 1 file and folder skeleton, including research context/state files, source registers, review lists, ledgers, terminology, feedback, memory files, artefact registry, app settings, `.gitignore`, source folders, artefact folders, output folders, logs, run summaries, and context versions.

Zotero config now stores both the selected `storage/` path and the parent Zotero directory when `sources.mode` is `zotero_storage`.

## 7. Source Workflow Audit

Implemented:

- Discover local source files.
- Hash files.
- Detect duplicates by hash.
- Create source IDs.
- Mark new sources as `pending_review` or `maybe`.
- Accept, ignore, and maybe source workflow.
- Exclude ignored/accepted/maybe state per workspace.

Missing or future:

- Metadata-only source status.
- Failed conversion status.
- Conversion outputs and metadata.
- Data profile statuses.
- Manual review required status beyond current config flag.
- Downstream enforcement that only accepted sources are used for research tasks.

## 8. Zotero Audit

Implemented:

- Detect default Zotero `storage/` path on macOS and Windows.
- Scan local Zotero storage folders.
- Store Zotero parent root automatically.
- Record Zotero storage key and relative storage path.
- Detect `.zotero-ft-cache`.
- Read local `zotero.sqlite` through immutable read-only SQLite connections.
- Link storage files to parent Zotero items.
- List local collections.
- Select one or more local collections for future scans.
- Include or exclude subcollections.
- Switch between entire-library and selected-collections mode.
- Search filenames, `.zotero-ft-cache`, title, creators, abstract, DOI, and collection paths deterministically.
- Generate metadata quality, attachment health, and full-text availability reports.
- Create local metadata snapshots.
- Enrich source-register entries with local Zotero metadata.
- Detect possible metadata duplicates by DOI or title/year.
- Export conservative BibTeX from local metadata.
- Avoid modifying Zotero files.
- Avoid writing into Zotero storage.
- Enforce the hard project rule that no CLI workflow, development workflow, or future AI feature may modify anything inside the local Zotero directory.
- Workspace config stores `strict_one_way_from_zotero_to_researchboss: true` and `block_writes_to_zotero_directory: true`.

Missing:

- Zotero local API.

## 9. Data Source Audit

Status: implemented for deterministic local MVP paths.

Implemented:

- CSV profiling.
- SQLite profiling.
- JSON source registration.
- Data source statuses.
- Data profile reports.
- No AI dataset upload behavior exists.

## 10. Artefact Audit

Status: implemented for deterministic local MVP paths.

Implemented:

- Artefact folders.
- `artefact-registry.yaml` shell.
- Artefact metadata records.
- Linked sources and research questions.
- AI-generated flag.
- `requires_user_review` flag.

## 11. AI and OpenAI Audit

Status: implemented for current safe-context MVP workflows.

Implemented:

- AI preference metadata.
- `ai.enabled: false` in local app settings.
- `.env` ignored.
- `.env.example` exists.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` loaded from environment or local `.env`.
- API key is not printed or logged.
- `researchboss ai test` writes a local readiness report.
- `researchboss ai context-preview --ai` writes a local safe context preview without making an OpenAI request.
- `researchboss ai review --ai` writes a local AI-assisted review report.
- `researchboss assess-novelty --ai` writes a local novelty report and appends `novelty-ledger.yaml`.
- `researchboss rqs assess --ai` writes a local AI-assisted research-question assessment report.
- Tests cover missing key behavior, key non-disclosure, explicit `--ai`, no default whole-document/dataset inclusion, mocked AI workflow outputs, and explicit external-search opt-in.

Missing:

- Corpus summary behavior.
- AI-assisted abstract screening for local abstract imports.
- Explicit full-file and directory opt-in modes.

Planned AI options:

- Workflows marked as not safely deterministic will be implemented only in the AI phase, not in the current deterministic engine.
- Research question strength, novelty, contribution certainty, field usefulness, and evidence-quality reasoning will be AI-assisted or human-review workflows, not deterministic validators.
- Explicit user-controlled options to allow AI to read an entire file when the user approves that level of context.
- Explicit user-controlled options to allow AI to read a directory of files when the user approves that level of context.
- Optional full-paper reasoning mode for consuming entire papers.
- Optional cross-reference mode where AI can compare full papers against in-progress artefacts.
- These modes must be disabled by default, must never modify Zotero, and must keep outputs inside the ResearchBoss workspace.

Future AI work that makes sense to implement next:

- AI-assisted abstract screening for locally imported abstracts, writing recommendations only.
- Explicit per-run full-file AI opt-in flags with warning output and tests.
- Explicit per-run directory AI opt-in flags with warning output and tests.

## 12. Tests Audit

Framework: pytest.

Current tested areas:

- CLI smoke tests.
- Workspace initialization.
- Source scanning and review.
- Workspace selection.
- Runtime checks.
- Local Zotero storage helpers, SQLite metadata, collection filtering, reports, snapshots, duplicate checks, BibTeX export, and CLI search.
- Conversion, metadata extraction, data profiling, artefact registry, research questions, claims, reports, watch, backup, and migration.

Current expected validation:

```bash
python -m py_compile researchboss/cli.py researchboss/engine/*.py researchboss/core/*.py
python -m pytest
```

Recommended next tests:

- Integrated review workflow tests once review commands are added.
- Future AI privacy-boundary tests before any AI implementation.

## 13. Security and Privacy Audit

Current privacy posture:

- MVP does not require cloud services.
- No external academic search.
- No AI document upload behavior exists.
- Source files are read-only inputs.
- Zotero storage is read-only.
- The local Zotero directory is a hard no-write boundary for current and future non-AI or AI workflows.
- Future AI whole-file, whole-directory, full-paper, and artefact cross-reference modes must be explicit opt-in settings and must preserve the Zotero no-write boundary.
- `.env` is ignored.

Known follow-up:

- Add tests for future AI privacy boundaries before implementing AI-assisted flows.

## 14. Documentation Audit

Implemented:

- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `TODO.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `DETAILED_ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/api/CONTRACT.md`
- Setup and test instructions.
- Initial OpenAI and Zotero notes.
- Local-first privacy boundaries.

Missing:

- Desktop/web/mobile strategy.
- Packaging documentation.

## 15. Immediate Next Steps

Phase 1 through Phase 4 offline deterministic work is complete for the current roadmap. Remaining work is either Phase 2 enhancement, API/backend work, AI work, UI preparation, or packaging.

1. Add richer PDF extraction using an optional local dependency.
   - Why: current PDF support is intentionally conservative for simple uncompressed streams.
   - Likely files: conversion engine, docs, tests.
   - Tests: realistic PDF fixture.
   - Complexity: medium.
   - Phase: 2 enhancement, not blocking Phase 2 completion.

2. Start a minimal FastAPI local backend skeleton.
   - Why: the API contract now exists and can be implemented as a thin transport layer over the tested engine.
   - Likely files: `researchboss/api`, tests, `docs/api/CONTRACT.md`.
   - Tests: API route tests.
   - Complexity: high.
   - Phase: 6.

3. Design AI privacy-boundary tests before AI implementation.
   - Why: AI features must not upload full documents or datasets unless explicitly opted in by the user.
   - Likely files: future AI engine contracts, tests, docs.
   - Tests: key handling, context limits, no key logging, no default uploads.
   - Complexity: medium.
   - Phase: 5.

## 15a. Useful Ideas Learned From `../pdf-merge`

The old project is useful as a reference for ResearchBoss, but its cloud-sync and external-search assumptions should not be copied into the MVP. Useful patterns to port or redesign:

- A richer local document-processing layer with optional PyMuPDF/PyPDF2 extraction and local OCR fallback.
- Sidecar metadata readers for CSL JSON, BibTeX, and RIS.
- Abstract and keyword extraction from sidecar files and early PDF pages.
- Accepted-source text corpus export with strong source headers and separators.
- PDF merge artefacts for accepted sources, including batch and library-wide outputs.
- Merge manifests, index files, and CSV reports for reproducible generated artefacts.
- Deterministic title/author/year filename normalization for generated outputs only.
- Local abstract import/screening workflows for already collected abstracts.
- Query-plan and query-history utilities for a later post-MVP external search phase.

Not suitable for MVP right now:

- Google Drive sync.
- External Scopus search.
- Any workflow that moves, renames, or modifies original source files.
- Any workflow that writes inside Zotero storage.

## 16. Recommended Resume Point

Resume with either a Phase 2 PDF extraction enhancement, a minimal Phase 6 FastAPI local backend skeleton based on `docs/api/CONTRACT.md`, or Phase 5 AI privacy-boundary tests. Phase 1 through Phase 4 offline deterministic work is complete for the current roadmap. AI work remains intentionally separated until privacy-boundary tests are designed.

## 17. Maintenance Rule

Whenever development changes ResearchBoss behavior:

- Update this roadmap.
- Update `README.md` project version.
- Update package version in `pyproject.toml` and `researchboss/__init__.py` when releasing or committing user-visible feature work.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Keep tests passing before commit or push.
